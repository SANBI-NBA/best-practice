A space for everyone to contribute Quarto documents or other code files reflecting our collective decisions around best practices to be implemented in the development of NBA indicator workflows, repositories, and website.

Please give your files a descriptive name so that it is easy to understand what the topic of your contribution is. If your contribution consists of multiple files, please create a subfolder for them. We are not sure yet what we are going to do with the content - we may compile it into a technical and best practice guide, or maybe create a mini website.
